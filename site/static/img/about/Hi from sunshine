Hi


I am thrilled to be applying to Southwest Airlines and I am confident that I would be an asset to Southwest Airlines.

After raising my two kids, and sending them off to college, I am excited to pursue my dream of being a flight attendant. 

I have the skills and experience to do an excellent job. I have 25 years  specifically I have handled thousands of guests 

Team player

Dedicated to customer service

I am super-detailed 

I always open and close restaurant and make sure everthing is ready for the next shift or event. 

Always willing to go above and beyond

Excellent mult-tasker

My banquet experience and managing the customer experience at the ski lodge proves I have physical ability to work on my feet for long shifts.
